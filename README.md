# SensejGameJam2020

Game created for SenseiGameJam in 2020 in team of 3:
- Krzysztof Siera
- Mateusz Klonica
- Konrad Perli≈Ñski

Game is a platformer where eating healthy food makes you lose HP, but allows you to jump higher while fast-food makes you heavier but allows to take more damage. 

We were trying to make game darker in later levels but but we run out of time. However game in this stage is definitely playable enven if it is bit unpolished.
